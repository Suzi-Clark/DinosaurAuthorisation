# Dinosaur Auth App

This project began as a hackathon project created with [@AndyRoo0](https://github.com/AndyRoo0) to introduce us to the concepts of authorisation and authentication and to use Auth0 for the first time.

I am now continuing this project alone to teach myself more about Auth0, React and CSS and to add a load of new featuers to the project.

## Features

**Post Hackathon Features:**
- Functioning login/logout buttons and dinosaur images that only display on the homepage when you are logged in
- Clickable user image when logged in that leads to another 'page' (using React Router DOM) where you can see your user data including metadata
- Image shown to the user of their favourite dinosaur (based on hard-coded metadata information)
- Functioning back button to return to 'homepage' (using React Router DOM)
- Some CSS (predominently on 'homepage' and buttons)

**Planned Personal Project Work - Extra Features:**
- Fix partially broken 'show user their favourite dinosaur image' feature
- Refactor to try out ternaries and switch statements (for my own learning)
- Create the project in my own Auth0 account (instead of through hackathon partner's)
- Refactore React Component tree structure for ease of passing down metadata props
- Create a form for users to fill in their favourite colour, dinosaur and nickname
- Create POST/PUT request(s) within a useEffect to send this data to Auth0
- Show this data within another 'YourInfo' component - perhaps rendered beside the form
- Use the favourite colour metadata to change the look of the MainPage component in some way
- Try out some flexbox and extend current CSS use

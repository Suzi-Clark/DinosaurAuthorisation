PLAN

MVP:
- install react and set up App.js ✅
- create login component button ✅
- create logout button component ✅
- if logged in show main page component - (dinosaur pictures) ✅

STRETCH:
- change favicon and title of app ✅
- make it so if you click on user image it renders a page with react router DOM with their data on
- having the user input data/a form and having the info display only when they're logged in
- bit of CSS

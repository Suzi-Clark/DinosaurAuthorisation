# Dinosaur Auth App ðŸ¦–

This project began as a hackathon project created with [@AndyRoo0](https://github.com/AndyRoo0) to introduce us to the concepts of authorisation and authentication and to use Auth0 for the first time.

I am now continuing this project alone to teach myself more about Auth0, React and CSS and to add a load of new featuers to the project.

## Features

**Hackathon Features:**
- Login/logout buttons and dinosaur images that only display when logged in
- Clickable user image when logged in that leads to another 'page' where you can see your data and metadata
- Image shown to the user of their favourite dinosaur (based on hard-coded metadata information)
- Functioning back button to return to 'homepage'
- Some CSS on 'homepage' and buttons

**Personal Project Work - Extra Features Created Since Hackathon:**
- Show user their favourite dinosaur image feature now fully functional âœ…
- Refactored to use ternaries âœ…
- Project now linked to my own Auth0 account âœ…
- Login/Logout refactored into one component âœ…
- Rainbow CSS effect on login button âœ…
